# Hardhat Project - Ethereum Smart Contract Development

Welcome to this Hardhat-based Ethereum smart contract development project. This repository includes a sample smart contract, automated tests, and deployment scripts to help you get started with blockchain development using Hardhat.

## Overview
Hardhat is a powerful Ethereum development environment that provides essential tools for compiling, testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts. This project demonstrates a basic use case of Hardhat and provides step-by-step instructions to run essential tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: LTS)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (Installed via npm or yarn)
- A [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet (Optional for interacting with the contract on a test network)
- A blockchain network (Hardhat Network or external Ethereum testnet/mainnet)

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Compile the Smart Contract
Before deploying, compile the smart contract to ensure there are no errors:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Run Tests
Execute the test scripts to verify the smart contract functionality:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
To run tests with gas reporting enabled:
```sh
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

### 5. Start a Local Ethereum Node
Use the Hardhat network to test smart contracts in a local development environment:
```sh
npx hardhat node
```
This will launch a local blockchain with funded test accounts.

### 6. Deploy the Contract
Deploy your smart contract to the local Hardhat network:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
To deploy on an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli), configure your Hardhat `hardhat.config.js` file with the network details and run:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
